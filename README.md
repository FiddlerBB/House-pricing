House Pricing
Hello, this is my little project which help me understand more about analyzing and statistic. 
We will take a good look with data we have here, it contains various factors which affect the price such as: area, basement, year built...
But do all of those listed factors in the data are really important? Or they just outlier? For example: the area of garage and number of cars in garage, they are literally the same, dont you think? 
So our mission here is to point out which one is the most important and which one is not.
